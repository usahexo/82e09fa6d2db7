which ones will make the top 10 list. But we can take a guess!\n\nThe Dark Knight and The Hunger Games are both surefire bets for a top 10 spot. They're both box office hits with great reviews, and they're sure to entertain audiences for years to come.\n\nIron Man 3 is another movie that is likely to make the top 10. It has had huge success at the box office, and it features some great action sequences and special effects.\n\nFinally, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is also likely to make the list. The first installment in the new trilogy has already made over $1 billion at the box office, and it's sure to please fans of the book series.\n\nThese are just a few of the movies that are likely to make the top 10 list this year. Be sure to check back later in the year to see which ones actually made it!\n\n#  Who will decide which movies make the list?\n\nThe Academy Awards have been a staple in the movie industry for over 90 years. Every year, people tune in to see who will take home the famous gold statue. However, there is always debate over which movies should be nominated, and more importantly, which ones should win. This has led to accusations of the Academy being out of touch with the public, and not nominating the right films.\n\nBut who decides which movies make the list? The nominations are voted on by members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). This is a group of around 7000 individuals who are film professionals such as actors, directors, and producers. So while there may be public outcry over some of the nominations or lack thereof, it ultimately falls on those within the Academy to decide.\n\nThis year’s nominees have been met with criticism from both audiences and industry professionals. Some feel that Roma was unfairly given a nod over films like A Star is Born and Green Book. Others argue thatBohemian Rhapsody was undeserving of its five nominations. No matter where you stand on this year’s nominees, it’s clear that there is always going to be some debate surrounding them.\n\nThe Academy has been trying to make its voting process more transparent in recent years. In an effort to combat accusations that they are out of touch, they have released a list of all voting members and made their ballots public. However, this has done little to quiet the critics. And with new controversies arising every year, it seems likely that this debate will continue for some time to come.\n\n#  How will they decide which movies make the list? \n\nAs we get closer to the 2019 release of the highly anticipated \"Avengers: Endgame,\" Marvel Cinematic Universe fans are starting to ask one question more and more frequently: What will happen to the MCU after \"Endgame?\" \n\nWhile there are many questions surrounding the future of the MCU, one of the most pressing is how will Marvel determine which movies make the list of films that make up the MCU? \n\nThere are a few contenders for what could be the deciding factor. \n\nThe first is box office numbers. This seems like an obvious choice, as the box office numbers would give an idea of which movies are most popular with audiences. However, this may not be the best indicator, as some lesser known or unpopular movies could still be integral parts of the MCU. \n\nAnother possibility is critical reception. This would take into account how well individual movies were received by both critics and audiences. While this metric could give a better indication of how well-liked a movie is, it could also be flawed since not all movies receive reviews and some that do may still have mixed reactions. \n\nThe third possibility is fan reaction. This would measure how enthusiastic fans are about each movie and could be a good indicator of how important they are to the overall story arc of the MCU. However, fan reaction can also be fickle and can change over time. \n\nSo, what will be the deciding factor for Marvel when it comes to determining which movies make up the MCU? The answer is that it’s likely going to be a combination of all three factors: box office numbers, critical reception, and fan reaction. This way, Marvel can ensure that the most important and well-loved movies make it into the MCU while also taking into account how popular they are with audiences.\n\n#  What are some factors that might go into deciding which movies make the list?\n\nThere are many factors that might go into deciding which movies make the list, but some of the most important ones include box office earnings, critical reception, and audience appeal.\n\nOne of the most important factors in deciding which movies make the list is box office earnings. The higher a movie’s box office earnings are, the more likely it is to make it onto the list. However, this is not the only factor that is considered; critical reception is also taken into account. If a movie has earned mostly negative reviews from critics, then it is less likely to make it onto the list than a movie that has earned mostly positive reviews. Finally, audience appeal is also taken into account. If a movie isn’t very popular with audiences, then it is less likely to make it onto the list.\n\nAll of these factors are considered when determining which movies make the list, but no one factor is more important than the others. It all depends on how each movie stacks up against the others.\n\n#  Will there be any surprises on the list?\n\nEvery year, the NFL releases its list of players who have been selected to play in the upcoming Pro Bowl. The voting is done by the fans, coaches, and players, and it is generally considered to be a prestigious award. This year’s list was announced on Tuesday and there were some notable omissions.\n\nQuarterback Tom Brady, who led the New England Patriots to another Super Bowl victory this year, was not selected to play in the Pro Bowl. Brady has been named to the Pro Bowl nine times in his career, but this year he was passed over in favor of other quarterbacks like Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers. Wide receiver Antonio Brown, who had a record-breaking season with the Pittsburgh Steelers, was also left off the list. Other big names who did not make the cut include Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald and Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.\n\nThe Pro Bowl will be played on January 28th in Orlando, Florida. The game will feature AFC against NFC and will be televised on ESPN.","source":"_posts/Which-movies-will-make-the-top-10-list.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Which movies will make the top 10 list\ndate: 2022-08-17 20:44:22\ncategories:\n- movie news\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Which movies will make the top 10 list?\n\nThere are so many great movies to choose from, it's hard to determine which ones will make the top 10 list.
