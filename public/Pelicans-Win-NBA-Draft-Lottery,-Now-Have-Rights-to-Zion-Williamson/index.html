Williamson is a freshman at Duke University, and is considered to be the best player in this year’s draft class.</p>
<p>This is a huge win for the Pelicans, who are coming off of a disappointing season in which they missed the playoffs. Williamson is a physical freak, with a massive frame and explosive athleticism. He has drawn comparisons to other NBA stars such as LeBron James and Kevin Durant.</p>
<p>If the Pelicans can manage to sign Williamson, they could be on the verge of becoming a contender in the Western Conference. The Lakers, who had previously been the favorites to land Williamson, are now likely to select someone else with the number one pick.</p>

But, that can be difficult when you’re dealing with an Excel spreadsheet. Particularly, if you’re new to sports betting altogether. Luckily, we’re here to help with a guide on how to successfully map an Excel spreadsheet for sports betting, using the New Orleans Pelicans as our example.</p>
<p>The first thing you want to do is list each team and their corresponding matchup in one column. In the second column, list each team’s odds of winning (or cover).In the third column, list each team’s implied probability of winning (based on the odds from column 2).</p>
<p>Next, calculate each team’s chance of winning by multiplying their implied probability by 100 and dividing by sum of all probabilities. This will give you a percentage for each team. Now, it’s time to fill in the rest of your Excel sheet!</p>
<p>In the fourth column, list each team’s odds of losing (or not covering). In the fifth column, list each team’s odds of winning straight up (without factoring in the spread). In the sixth column, list each team’s odds of losing straight up (again, without factoring in the spread).</p>
<p>Next, create a grid with two rows and six columns. In the first row, list each game along with its corresponding date. In the next row down, fill in the percentage chances for each outcome (win, loss or cover) that you calculated earlier. For example:</p>
<p>Now that you have your Excel spreadsheet mapped out, it’s time to put some money down on some games!</p>
<h1 id="Pelicans-Start-Offseason-by-Mapping-an-Excel-Spreadsheet-for-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Pelicans-Start-Offseason-by-Mapping-an-Excel-Spreadsheet-for-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Pelicans Start Offseason by Mapping an Excel Spreadsheet for Sports Betting"></a>Pelicans Start Offseason by Mapping an Excel Spreadsheet for Sports Betting</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans are fresh off a 2017-2018 season in which they made the playoffs for the first time since 2015. That run was cut short, though, as they were swept out of the first round by the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>Now, as the offseason begins, the Pelicans have some important decisions to make. They have seven players under contract for next season and will have about $21 million in cap space to work with.</p>
<p>One of their main priorities this offseason is re-signing center DeMarcus Cousins, who is set to become a free agent on July 1. Cousins had an excellent season in New Orleans before tearing his Achilles tendon in January.</p>
<p>The Pelicans will also need to decide what to do with point guard Rajon Rondo, who is also a free agent. Rondo played well for New Orleans after being traded from the Chicago Bulls in February, but it’s unclear whether he will be back next season.</p>
<p>Another key decision for the Pelicans this offseason is what to do with guard Jrue Holiday. Holiday is also set to become a free agent and could sign a big contract elsewhere. He has said that he wants to stay in New Orleans, but the team may not be able to afford him.</p>
<p>Assuming Cousins and Rondo both re-sign with the Pelicans, they will have about $14 million left to spend on other players. They could use that money to upgrade their roster or save it for next year’s free agency period.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways the Pelicans could use their $21 million in cap space this offseason. Here’s a look at some of the possibilities:</p>
<p>Re-sign DeMarcus Cousins: The most obvious thing the Pelicans could do with their cap space is re-sign DeMarcus Cousins. Cousins was having an MVP-caliber season before tearing his Achilles tendon and would be a huge boost for them next year. The question is how much money he will demand and whether the Pelicans can afford him.</p>
<p>Sign another big man: If they can’t afford Cousins, the Pelicans could try to sign another big man like Aaron Gordon or Julius Randle. Both players are young and would be a good fit next to Anthony Davis and Boogie Cousins.</p>
<p>Sign a point guard: If Rajon Rondo leaves, the Pelicans could try to sign another point guard like Terry Rozier or Kemba Walker. Rozier played well for Boston last year and would be a good backup for Jrue Holiday. Kemba Walker is one of the best point guards in the league and would be an upgrade over Rondo.</p>
<p>Trade Jrue Holiday: If they can’t afford Jrue Holiday, the Pelicans could try to trade him for some salary cap relief. There are a few teams that would be interested in him, including the Phoenix Suns and Orlando Magic.</p>
<h1 id="Pelican’s-Use-Mapping-an-Excel-Spreadsheet-for-Sports-Betting-Successfully"><a href="#Pelican’s-Use-Mapping-an-Excel-Spreadsheet-for-Sports-Betting-Successfully" class="headerlink" title="Pelican’s Use Mapping an Excel Spreadsheet for Sports Betting Successfully"></a>Pelican’s Use Mapping an Excel Spreadsheet for Sports Betting Successfully</h1><p>Like most people, you probably know at least one person who makes a living betting on sports. You might even wonder how they do it, especially if you’ve never placed a sports bet in your life. The truth is, it’s not too difficult to be successful with sports betting as long as you employ some basic strategies. In this article, we’re going to teach you one of those strategies: how to use mapping an Excel spreadsheet for sports betting success.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the specifics of this strategy, let’s first take a look at why mapping an Excel spreadsheet is beneficial for sports betting. Essentially, this approach allows you to track historical data and trends for each team and game that you’re considering betting on. By doing so, you can better understand how teams have performed in the past and what factors may have influenced their performance. This information can then be used to make more informed betting decisions.</p>
<p>Now that you understand why mapping an Excel spreadsheet is useful for sports betting, let’s take a look at how to actually do it. The first step is to create a spreadsheet that includes all of the pertinent data for each team and game that you’re considering betting on. This data could include things like the teams’ overall records, their most recent results, the location of the game, and the odds for each side.</p>
<p>Once you have your spreadsheet populated with data, it’s time to start mapping it. To do this, simply create a column for each piece of data and then plot the data points using graphs or charts. This will allow you to see any trends or patterns that may exist between different aspects of the game. For example, if you notice that one team always seems to win when playing at home but lose when playing away games, then this information can be used to help inform your bets.</p>
<p>While mapping an Excel spreadsheet can be a helpful tool for sports bettors, it’s important to remember that no strategy is guaranteed to win every time. So always make sure to do your own research and analysis before placing any bets.</p>
