The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford, also found that there is a higher rate of problem gambling among men than women.</p>
<p>The study surveyed over 20,000 adults in over 20 different countries and found that gambling is particularly popular among young people, with nearly half of all 18 to 24-year-olds gambling online. The study also found that problem gambling rates are highest in Europe, with around 1% of the population experiencing problems with their gambling habits.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for individuals and families, leading to financial problems, relationship breakdowns, and even suicide. There are treatments available for those who suffer from a gambling addiction, but it can be a difficult addiction to overcome.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help. There are many support groups and resources available for those who need them.</p>
<h1 id="Australians-are-Biggest-Gamblers-in-the-World"><a href="#Australians-are-Biggest-Gamblers-in-the-World" class="headerlink" title="Australians are Biggest Gamblers in the World"></a>Australians are Biggest Gamblers in the World</h1><p>Australians gamble more than any other nationality in the world. This is according to a study conducted by London-based research firm H2 Gambling Capital, which found that Australians wagered $1,206 per capita in 2016. This figure was well ahead of the US, which came in second with $747 per capita, and the UK, which placed third with $608 per capita.</p>
<p>The study also found that Australian gambling losses totaled $24.4 billion in 2016, or 3.8% of GDP. This was also the highest percentage loss in the world, followed by Singapore (3.6%) and Ireland (3.5%). By comparison, gambling losses account for just 2.5% of GDP in the US and 1.7% of GDP in the UK.</p>
<p>So why do Australians love to gamble so much? One reason may be that Australia has a diverse range of gambling options available, including casino games, lotteries, poker machines, and sports betting. Australians can also gamble online or on their smartphones, making it easy to wager no matter where they are.</p>
<p>Another reason may be that Australian casinos offer some of the best odds in the world. For example, the odds on blackjack are 3:2 in Australia compared to 2:1 in Las Vegas. And since Aussies love to bet on sport, they can take advantage of good odds and make some serious profits.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, it’s clear that Australians love to gamble!</p>
<h1 id="Casinos-Are-Benefiting-from-the-Growth-of-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Casinos-Are-Benefiting-from-the-Growth-of-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Casinos Are Benefiting from the Growth of Online Gambling"></a>Casinos Are Benefiting from the Growth of Online Gambling</h1><p>Casinos have been around since the 1800s, and their popularity has only grown in recent decades. In fact, casino gambling is now a $45 billion industry in the United States alone.1 And while brick-and-mortar casinos still account for the lion’s share of gambling revenue, online gambling is growing at an impressive rate. In 2017, online gambling was a $25.5 billion industry, and it is expected to grow to $52.5 billion by 2025.2</p>
<p>What’s behind this growth? There are a few reasons. First, online gambling is more convenient than traditional casinos. You can play from anywhere in the world with an internet connection, and you don’t have to dress up or leave home to do it. Second, online casinos offer more games than traditional casinos do. This includes everything from slots and blackjack to poker and sports betting. Third, online casinos typically have lower stakes than traditional casinos do, which makes them accessible to a wider range of people.</p>
<p>Why are casinos benefiting from this growth? The answer is simple: because they are getting a piece of the action. Online casinos pay out billions of dollars in winnings every year, and that money goes straight into the coffers of casino operators. In addition, online casinos drive traffic to brick-and-mortar casinos. When people gamble online, there’s a good chance they’ll visit a casino later on to try their luck in person.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that online gambling is growing rapidly and provides significant benefits for both players and casino operators alike. If you’re interested in trying your hand at some online casino games, there are plenty of excellent options available – just be sure to research the different sites before you choose one</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Governor-Signs-Bill-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Governor-Signs-Bill-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Governor Signs Bill to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Governor Signs Bill to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>CARSON CITY, Nev. – Nevada has moved one step closer to legalizing online gambling after Governor Brian Sandoval signed a bill into law on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The new law, which goes into effect on October 1, allows licensed casinos in the state to offer online poker, blackjack and other casino games to people inside Nevada. It also permits the use of mobile devices for gambling purposes.</p>
<p>“This is a historic day for the state of Nevada,” said Governor Sandoval. “I am proud to sign this bill into law and look forward to seeing our casinos launch their online platforms that will allow people from all over the world to experience all that our great state has to offer.”</p>
<p>The passage of the new law comes after years of debate on the issue in Nevada. Casino operators have been pushing for its legalization in order to compete with illegal offshore gambling sites, while opponents have raised concerns about the potential for addiction and underage gambling.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval said that he is committed to ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect consumers. “We have learned from other states what works and what doesn’t work, and we have put in place some of the strongest consumer protections in the country,” he said.</p>
<p>Nevada joins New Jersey as one of two US states where online gambling is legal. Operators in both states are facing competition from unregulated offshore sites, which continue to take a significant share of the market.</p>
<h1 id="Global-Online-Gambling-Market-to-Hit-33-Billion-by-2020"><a href="#Global-Online-Gambling-Market-to-Hit-33-Billion-by-2020" class="headerlink" title="Global Online Gambling Market to Hit $33 Billion by 2020"></a>Global Online Gambling Market to Hit $33 Billion by 2020</h1><p>The global online gambling market is forecast to generate $33 billion in revenue by 2020, up from $24.5 billion in 2015, according to new research from Juniper Research. This represents a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.8%.</p>
<p>The growth will be driven by the increasing uptake of mobile gambling, which is expected to account for over 60% of global online gambling revenue by 2020. This is due to the continued proliferation of smartphones and tablets, as well as the increasing availability of casino games and betting apps.</p>
<p> North America will remain the largest regional market, accounting for 36% of global online gambling revenue in 2020. However, the region’s share is expected to decline from 42% in 2015 as other regions experience faster growth. The Asia Pacific region is forecast to be the fastest-growing, with a CAGR of 9.7%, followed by Latin America at 8.6%.</p>
<p>In terms of individual products, casino games are expected to be the largest category globally, accounting for 34% of total online gambling revenue in 2020. This reflects the popularity of desktop and mobile slots and roulette games among consumers. In contrast, sports betting will be the fastest-growing category, with a CAGR of 11.2%, followed by poker at 10.4%.</p>
