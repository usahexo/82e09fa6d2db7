<ol start="2">

<ol start="4">
<li>Set limits for yourself and stick to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Decide how much money you are allowed to spend on gambling each week and stick to it. This will help you stay within budget and avoid getting into debt because of your addiction.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Make a commitment to stop gambling forever.</li>

<p>Making a commitment to yourself that you will never gamble again is an important step in overcoming your addiction. It takes time and effort, but being able to say that you will never gamble again is a very powerful statement.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Avoid isolation.</li>

<h1 id="How-to-Avoid-Gambling-and-protect-your-finances"><a href="#How-to-Avoid-Gambling-and-protect-your-finances" class="headerlink" title="How to Avoid Gambling and protect your finances"></a>How to Avoid Gambling and protect your finances</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and thrilling experience but when it is not done responsibly, it can quickly become a costly addiction. Here are a few tips on how to avoid gambling and protect your finances:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose - Gambling should never be seen as a way to make money. If you cannot afford to lose the amount of money you are planning to gamble, then do not gamble at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set limits and stick to them - Decide beforehand how much money you are willing to spend on gambling and stick to that amount. Once you have reached your limit, walk away from the table or machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid temptation - If possible, try not to go to casinos or gaming venues where gambling is available. If you do find yourself in such a situation, leave as soon as possible if you are feeling tempted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Educate yourself about gambling addiction - If you are concerned that you may be developing a gambling addiction, educate yourself about the signs and symptoms of addiction. This will help you deal with any potential issues early on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get help if needed - If you think that you may have a gambling addiction or if gambling is causing problems in your life, seek professional help. There are many good support groups and counsellors available who can help you overcome your addiction</p>
</li>

<li><p>Set a budget and stick to it<br>When you’re setting your budget, make sure to consider how much money you can comfortably afford to lose without putting your financial security at risk. It’s important to be honest with yourself and not gamble with money you need for other expenses. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid places where gambling is prevalent<br>If you know that there are several casinos or poker rooms in your area, it’s best to avoid them altogether. The temptation to gamble can be too strong if you’re constantly surrounded by gambling establishments. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay away from online gambling websites<br>Online gambling websites can be very addictive and dangerous, so it’s best to stay away from them altogether. There are many legitimate websites where you can gamble online, but be sure to do your research before choosing one. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t bet on anything you don’t know about<br>If you’re not familiar with the sport or game that you’re betting on, it’s best not to bet at all. Trying to predict the outcome of an event when you don’t know what you’re doing is a recipe for disaster. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Set a time limit for each gambling session<br>When you’re gambling, set a time limit for yourself and stick to it. This will help prevent you from spending too much time gambling and losing track of time.<br>It’s also a good idea to take periodic breaks during your session so that you don’t get too fatigued. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose<br>As mentioned earlier, it’s important to only gamble with money that you can afford to lose without putting your finances at risk. Gambling with money that needs to be used for other expenses is a recipe for disaster. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Know when to walk away from the table&#x2F;slot machine&#x2F;etc…<br>If things aren’t going well and you’re starting to lose money, it’s best to walk away from the table&#x2F;slot machine&#x2F;etc… immediately. There’s no point in risking even more money when there’s a good chance you’ll end up losing even more than what you’ve already lost. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t drink or use drugs while gambling<br>Drinking or using drugs while gambling can lead to poor decision making and increased chances of losing money. It’s best not to mix alcohol or drugs with gambling, as it can have disastrous consequences. 9</p>
