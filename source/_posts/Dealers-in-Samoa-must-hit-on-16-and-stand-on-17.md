#  Dealers in Samoa must hit on 16 and stand on 17

Gambling in the territory of Samoa is governed by the Gambling Act 2006. The act sets out the rules for different types of gambling, including casinos, betting, and lotteries. The act also establishes a regulatory body known as the Casino Control Authority (CCA), which is responsible for licensing and regulating gambling operators in Samoa.

Under the Gambling Act 2006, casino dealers in Samoa must hit on 16 and stand on 17. This rule applies to both natural and artificial blackjack games. In addition, casino dealers are not allowed to offer advice to players on whether they should hit or stand.

The Gambling Act 2006 also prohibits casinos from offering certain types of games, including Pontoon and Mini Baccarat. These games are prohibited because they are considered to be too favourable to the player.

#  Dealers in Samoa must hit on soft 17

In Samoa, casino dealers are required to stand on soft 17. This rule came into effect in 2012, and applies to all casino games.

The purpose of the rule is to protect players and ensure a fair game. Dealers must hit on any hand where the total is less than 17, including hands where the ace is counted as 1. This protects players from making risky decisions when their hand could still end up losing.

The rule also benefits dealers, as it increases the chances that they will make a winning hand. This can help to keep them in the game, and reduces the risk of them having to payout large sums of money to players.

#  Dealers in Samoa must stand on all 17s

The "Criminal Code" of Samoa prohibits car dealerships from occupying any space other than on all 17s. 
This law was seemingly created to protect the small businesses that are dealer franchises in Samoa, as well as to ensure that buyers have a fair negotiation process.

Since the enactment of this law, car dealers in Samoa must occupy at least one-seventeenth of their lot space with a physical representation of their business. This space cannot be used for parking or any other purpose, and must be visible to anyone passing by.

Violators of this law may face a fine of up to $2000 Samoan tala (approximately $520 USD), imprisonment for up to 6 months, or both.

#  Blackjack dealers in Samoa must hit on 16 and stand on all 17s

While the basic rules of blackjack are universal, there are some regional differences that can surprise first-time players. In Samoa, for example, dealers must hit on 16 and stand on all 17s. This creates a different strategy for players in the country, as they need to be more aggressive in order to win.

Elsewhere, some casinos forbid players from splitting Aces, while others allow it depending on the dealer's upcard. In general, it's a good idea to ask the dealer about any specific rules before playing. That way, you can make sure you're playing by the same standards as everyone else in the casino and avoid any surprises.
