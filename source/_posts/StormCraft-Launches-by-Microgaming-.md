#  StormCraft Launches by Microgaming 

July was a big month for online casino fans, as two new casinos were launched. The first was RedSlots Casino, which came online on the 7th. Then, on the 21st, StormCraft Casino went live.

Both of these casinos are powered by Microgaming software. This ensures that they offer a top-notch gaming experience, with high quality graphics and smooth gameplay.

#  How Old do I have to be to Play in the Casino? 

The legal gambling age in the United States is 21 years old. This is set federally and applies to all states. However, each state is able to set its own laws about gambling within its borders. 

Some states have higher minimum ages for gambling, while others have lower minimum ages. There are also a few states that don’t have any laws about gambling age, leaving it up to the individual casinos to decide what the minimum age is. 

Most of the time, if you are under 21 years old, you will not be able to gamble in a casino. There are a few exceptions, such as playing bingo or buying State Lottery tickets. But for the most part, if you want to gamble in a casino, you need to be 21 years old or older.

#  Microgaming Launches New Slot Game: StormCraft 

Microgaming, a leading software provider for online casinos, has announced the launch of their latest slot game: StormCraft.

The game is set in a stormy night sky, and players must help the chosen character to find their way home by collecting rewards along the way. There are five different characters to choose from, each with their own unique bonuses. The game also offers a progressive jackpot which can be won by hitting the right combination of symbols.

#  Play StormCraft and Experience the Power of Nature!

Do you love strategy games? If yes, then you should definitely try out StormCraft. This game is all about using the power of nature to your advantage and wipe out your opponents. With stunning graphics and exciting gameplay, StormCraft is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.

The premise of the game is simple – each player starts with a base on one corner of the map, and then must gather resources in order to build an army and destroy the other player’s base. The map is filled with different types of trees, plants, and animals, all of which can be used to your advantage. For example, you can use the trees to create lumber mills, which will allow you to produce wood faster; or you can use the animals to create farms, which will give you food to eat.

In order to win, you’ll need to use your strategic skills to your advantage. You’ll need to build up your army quickly, and make sure that you have enough resources to support them. You’ll also need to make sure that your base is well-defended, so that the other player can’t destroy it easily.

If you’re looking for a fun and challenging strategy game, then be sure to try out StormCraft!
