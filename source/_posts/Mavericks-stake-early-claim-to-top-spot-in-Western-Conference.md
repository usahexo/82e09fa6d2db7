#  Mavericks stake early claim to top spot in Western Conference

It appeared that the Golden State Warriors were going to run away with the top spot in the Western Conference this season. But then a funny thing happened on their way to a seemingly inevitable championship – the Dallas Mavericks started playing some of the best basketball in the league.

Led by Dirk Nowitzki and Wesley Matthews, the Mavericks have been one of the most consistent teams in the NBA, sitting at second place in the West with a record of 37-20. And they’ve done it all while dealing with injuries to their starting center, Tyson Chandler, and key reserve J.J. Barea.

While Golden State still looks like the team to beat in the West, Dallas has shown that they are more than capable of competing with anyone. With Nowitzki and Matthews leading the way, look for them to make a deep playoff run this year.

#  Nowitzki scores 36 points as Mavericks cruise by Bulls

Dirk Nowitzki poured in 36 points to lead the Dallas Mavericks to a 112-86 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night.

Nowitzki shot 14-of-20 from the field, including 4-of-7 from 3-point range, as the Mavericks (41-26) won their third straight game and ninth in their last 11 contests.

Derrick Rose led the Bulls (27-37) with 24 points on 10-of-19 shooting, while Pau Gasol added 15 points and 13 rebounds.

The Mavericks led by as many as 33 points en route to victory.

#  Parsons scores 27 as Mavericks take down Lakers

In a matchup between two of the league's marquee teams, the Dallas Mavericks pulled out a 120-113 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers behind 27 points from Harrison Barnes and 26 from Yogi Ferrell. For the Lakers, Kyle Kuzma led all scorers with 28 points.

The Mavericks started hot, shooting 60 percent in the first quarter to take a 38-29 lead. They were paced by Barnes, who had 14 points in the period. The Lakers rallied in the second quarter, tying the game at 62 midway through before Dallas took control again, ending the half up 92-85.

The Mavericks maintained their lead throughout the third quarter, pushing it to as many as 13 points. However, with Kuzma scoring 16 points in the period, the Lakers rallied and pulled to within 106-104 with just over four minutes remaining. But Dallas closed out strong, scoring 14 of the game's final 18 points to seal the win.

Barnes was magnificent for Dallas, shooting 10-of-19 from the field and 5-of-8 from three-point range. He added eight rebounds and five assists on the night. Ferrell was also sharp off the bench, shooting 9-of-13 from the field and 3-of-5 from beyond the arc. Kuzma led Los Angeles in scoring while Lonzo Ball added 10 assists and eight rebounds.

#  Playoff positioning on the line as Mavericks host Warriors

The Dallas Mavericks and Golden State Warriors meet Wednesday night with a lot on the line.

The Mavericks (39-29) are in fifth place in the Western Conference, but just one game ahead of the ninth-place Nuggets and 2.5 games ahead of the 10th-place Clippers. They also have a two-game lead over the Warriors (37-30), who are in seventh place.

If the playoffs started today, Dallas would be in and Golden State would be out. But there is still plenty of basketball to be played and Wednesday's matchup is an important one.

"We're all fighting for something," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "So it should be an energetic game."

Both teams will be without key players. Dallas will be without Dirk Nowitzki (knee) and Kristaps Porzingis (knee), while Golden State will be without Stephen Curry (ankle) and Klay Thompson (knee).

Dallas was able to beat the Warriors 127-123 on Jan. 3 despite 33 points from Curry. Nowitzki led the way for Dallas with 22 points and nine rebounds, while Luka Doncic had 21 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds. Thompson led Golden State with 25 points, while Kevon Looney added 20 off the bench.
