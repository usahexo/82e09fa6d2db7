#  Which James Bond Comes After Casino Royale?

For many moviegoers, the James Bond franchise begins with the release of "Dr. No" in 1962. However, for fans of Ian Fleming's novels, the first James Bond movie is "Casino Royale." This has caused some confusion over which James Bond comes after "Casino Royale."

In the novel "Casino Royale," James Bond is just a rookie agent who is trying to take down Le Chiffre. At the end of the novel, Bond is murdered by his archenemy, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. However, in the movie "Casino Royale," Bond is already a seasoned agent who has taken down many villains. This creates a continuity issue because the events of "Casino Royale" would have happened after the events of other Bond movies.

The issue was resolved in 2008 when the producers of the James Bond movies released "Quantum of Solace." This movie acts as a sequel to "Casino Royale" and it explains that the events of that movie occurred before other Bond movies. In "Quantum of Solace," James Bond is still trying to take down Le Chiffre and he eventually kills him.
