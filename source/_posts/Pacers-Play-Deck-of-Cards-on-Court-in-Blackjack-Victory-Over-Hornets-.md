#  Pacers Play Deck of Cards on Court in Blackjack Victory Over Hornets 

INDIANAPOLIS, IND. - The Indiana Pacers played a game of blackjack on the court against the Charlotte Hornets, and won 112-94. This unusual strategy helped lead to the Pacers victory.

The team used a deck of cards as they would in a game of blackjack, with players taking turns being the dealer. They would then play cards against the Hornets as if it were a traditional blackjack game.

"We just wanted to change things up and have some fun," said Pacers guard Victor Oladipo. "It worked out well."

The unorthodox strategy clearly confused the Hornets, who had no answer for the Pacers' offensive onslaught. Oladipo led the way with 26 points, while Darren Collison added 20 points off the bench.

"They really caught us off guard with that," said Hornets guard Kemba Walker. "We just didn't know how to respond."

The Pacers will look to keep the momentum going when they take on the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night.

#  Pacers Use Blackjack Strategy for Second Straight Win 

INDIANAPOLIS, IN - Pacers forward Thaddeus Young employed a blackjack strategy in the final minutes of the fourth quarter on Wednesday night to help secure a 123-111 victory over the visiting Houston Rockets.

With the game tied at 104 and just over three minutes remaining in regulation, Young pulled up for a jumper from the right wing. The shot missed, but he collected his own rebound and went back up with a layup. Young then hit another jumper from the wing, and followed that with another layup to give Indiana a 111-104 lead with 2:10 left on the clock.

"I just tried to stay aggressive," said Young. "I know my role on this team, and I try to do whatever I can to help us win."

Houston would pull within four points late, but Pacers guard Victor Oladipo iced the game with four free throws in the final seconds. It was Indiana's second straight win and improved their record to 27-22 on the season.

"We've been grinding out these wins," said Oladipo. "It's not always going to be easy, but we're finding ways to get it done."

The Pacers will look to make it three straight when they host the Miami Heat at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Friday night.

#  Indiana Pacers Use Decks of Cards to Beat Pistons in Blackjack Style 

In what could only be called an upset, the Indiana Pacers used decks of cards to beat the Detroit Pistons in a game of blackjack style. 

The Pistons, who were heavily favored going into the game, were caught off guard by the Pacers' creative strategy. The Pacers managed to score 84 points against the Pistons, who only scored 72.

"I have to give credit to our players for coming up with this ingenious strategy," said Pacers head coach Nate McMillan. "They really pulled off a upset victory today."

Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy was not pleased with his team's performance. "We just didn't play well today," he said. "Credit to the Pacers for taking advantage of that."

The game was played at the Palace of Auburn Hills in front of a sellout crowd.

#  Deck of Cards Leads Pacers to Victory Over Bucks in Blackjack Fashion 

Deck of Cards led the Pacers to a 114-101 victory over the Bucks in a game of blackjack on Thursday night.

The strategy was simple for Indiana: get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and use the deck of cards to keep track of their progress.

"We just used the deck of cards to keep track of our score, and it worked well," said Miles Plumlee. "I'm glad we were able to win."

The Pacers began the game with a quick 7-0 run, and never looked back. Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee with 24 points and 11 rebounds, but it wasn't enough to overcome Indiana's hot shooting.

"Our plan was to use the deck of cards to keep track of our score, and we were very successful tonight," said Paul George. "It was a great team win."

#  Pacers Defeat Knicks with a Deck of Cards in Hand

The Pacers may have just pulled off the upset of the century. Down by three points with only seconds remaining on the clock, they miraculously won the game with a deck of cards.

The late-game excitement began when Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis was fouled while attempting a shot. He calmly stepped to the free throw line and made both shots to give his team a 102-99 lead.

But there was still time on the clock for the Pacers. Guard Victor Oladipo sprinted downcourt and launched a 3-point shot that miraculously went in as the buzzer sounded, giving his team a 102-102 tie.

Both teams went into overtime, but it was the Pacers who came out on top. With only seconds left on the clock, guard Cory Joseph pulled out a deck of cards and successfully called an ace. The stunned Knicks players could only watch as the Pacers celebrated their improbable victory.

When asked about the unorthodox winning strategy, Joseph explained, "I just wanted to do something different to win this game." Pacers head coach Nate McMillan added, "We just used our brains and got creative. I'm proud of my guys for finding a way to win."

It's unclear whether or not other teams will begin using card games to win basketball games, but one thing is for sure - the Indiana Pacers are now one of the most exciting teams in the NBA.
