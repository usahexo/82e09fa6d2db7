#  10 ways to keep gambling out of your life 

1. Set a budget and stick to it
When you're setting your budget, make sure to consider how much money you can comfortably afford to lose without putting your financial security at risk. It's important to be honest with yourself and not gamble with money you need for other expenses. 

2. Avoid places where gambling is prevalent
If you know that there are several casinos or poker rooms in your area, it's best to avoid them altogether. The temptation to gamble can be too strong if you're constantly surrounded by gambling establishments. 

3. Stay away from online gambling websites
Online gambling websites can be very addictive and dangerous, so it's best to stay away from them altogether. There are many legitimate websites where you can gamble online, but be sure to do your research before choosing one. 

4. Don't bet on anything you don't know about
If you're not familiar with the sport or game that you're betting on, it's best not to bet at all. Trying to predict the outcome of an event when you don't know what you're doing is a recipe for disaster. 

5. Set a time limit for each gambling session
When you're gambling, set a time limit for yourself and stick to it. This will help prevent you from spending too much time gambling and losing track of time. 
It's also a good idea to take periodic breaks during your session so that you don't get too fatigued. 

6. Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose
As mentioned earlier, it's important to only gamble with money that you can afford to lose without putting your finances at risk. Gambling with money that needs to be used for other expenses is a recipe for disaster. 

7. Know when to walk away from the table/slot machine/etc…
If things aren't going well and you're starting to lose money, it's best to walk away from the table/slot machine/etc… immediately. There's no point in risking even more money when there's a good chance you'll end up losing even more than what you've already lost. 
8. Don't drink or use drugs while gambling
Drinking or using drugs while gambling can lead to poor decision making and increased chances of losing money. It's best not to mix alcohol or drugs with gambling, as it can have disastrous consequences. 9
