#  What is Rocket Dice?

Rocket Dice is a dice game that was designed by James Ernest and launched on Kickstarter in February of 2016. The game is for two to four players and takes about 20-30 minutes to play.

In Rocket Dice, players are trying to score points by landing their rockets on planets. They do this by rolling dice and then using the results to move their rockets around the board. The player who scores the most points wins the game.

# How to Play

The game is played over a number of rounds, with each player taking turns rolling dice and moving their rockets accordingly. In each round, players will roll six dice and must use all six results to make moves. The only exception is that they can reroll any of the dice they want one time.

There are three types of moves that a player can make:

+ Move their rocket forward one space.
+ Move their rocket sideways one space.  
+ Place a new rocket on the board (either in front of them or one of their opponents).

Players can also use the results of their die rolls to do things such as claiming bonuses, attacking opponents, and landing on planets. For more information on how these work, be sure to check out the official rules for Rocket Dice [1].

#  What is the Rocket Dice game?

Rocket Dice is a tabletop game that simulates a space race between two players. It was created by designer Cody Rush and was first released in 2017. 

The game board is a simple track that players use to navigate their dice-based ships around the track. Players can either move their ship forwards or spin it around to fire its weapons. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach the end of the track, or to destroy their opponentâ€™s ship.

Players must strategize in order to achieve victory, as they only have a limited number of moves each turn. The game can be played with 2 or 3 players, and takes around 30 minutes to complete.

# How do you play Rocket Dice?

The game is played by rolling dice and moving your ship along the track according to the results. Players can either move their ship forwards or spin it around to fire its weapons. You can also use your character's special power on your turn as long as you haven't moved yet. If you haven't moved yet and want to use your character's special power, just let everyone know and then take your turn afterwards. 

There are three different types of dice: movement, action, and weapon dice. When you roll your dice, you will get one movement die, one action die, and two weapon dice - unless you're using a character that has a different set up (ie: Captain Kirk). 

Your movement die tells you how many spaces you can move your ship on your turn - but you can only move in straight lines forward or backwards (unless you're using a character that has a different power). Your action die tells you what actions you can take on your turn - options include moving again, spinning your ship around to fire its weapons, or using your character's special power. Your weapon dice tell us how many shots we get with our weapons - but keep in mind that each weapon has a reload value which tells us how many times we can shoot per battle round (more on that later). 

You must decide what order you want to take these actions in: moving your ship, firing its weapons, or using your character's special power. So for example: if I had a 3 on my movement die and wanted to move my ship two spaces forward, then I would use my action die to "move again" since I've already moved my ship for this turn."

#  How do I play Rocket Dice?

Rocket Dice is a fast paced, dexterity game for 2-6 players. The goal of the game is to be the first player to score 21 points or more.

To begin, each player selects three dice of the same color. These will be your Rocket Ships. Players then take turns rolling their dice and moving their ships. On a player's turn they may roll all of their dice, or only some of them. After rolling, the player must move one of their ships according to the following rules:

* Red Dice can only move forwards or sideways
* Yellow Dice can only move backwards or sideways* Green Dice can move any direction

If a player cannot move their ship according to these rules, then they forfeit their turn.

After moving a ship, the player must then either reroll all of their dice and move again, OR set any unused dice aside and end their turn. If at any time all three of a player's Rocket Ships are off the game board, that player is out of the game. The last player standing is the winner!
