#  What are the latest movies in theaters?

Finding the latest movies in theaters can be a bit of a daunting task. Unless you live near a major city, chances are good that the only theater within reasonable driving distance is a multi-plex. And, unless you subscribe to a movie channel, there's no reliable way to know which movies are out there without spending a lot of time scouring the internet.

The best way to find out what's playing in your area is to visit your local movie theater's website or Facebook page. Most theaters list their current and upcoming movies on their websites. In addition, most theaters have social media pages where they post trailers and other information about the movies they're showing.

If you're looking for unbiased reviews, Rotten Tomatoes is a great resource. They aggregate critic and audience reviews to give each movie a "Tomatometer" score. You can also read individual reviews by clicking on the link for each movie.
