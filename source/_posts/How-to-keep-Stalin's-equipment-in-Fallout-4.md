#  How to keep Stalin's equipment in Fallout 4

In Fallout 4, there is a lot of equipment to find and use, but one of the most interesting items is Stalin's equipment. This items is not easy to find, but it can be very useful for players who want to make their character stronger. Here are some tips for finding and using Stalin's equipment in Fallout 4.

The best place to start looking for Stalin's equipment is in the Museum of Freedom in Boston. There is a room near the end of the museum that is filled with various pieces of equipment, and Stalin's equipment can be found there.Alternatively, players can also find Stalin's equipment at Fort Strong. This location is northeast of Boston, and it is home to a large number of powerful enemies. However, it is worth exploring this area if players want to get their hands on Stalin's equipment.

Once players have obtained Stalin's equipment, they will need to find a weapon that can use it. The best weapon to use with Stalin's equipment is the Railway Rifle. This weapon fires railway spikes at enemies, and it deals a lot of damage. If players are having trouble finding the Railway Rifle, they can purchase it from merchant named Moe Cronin at the East Boston Preparatory School.

With the Railway Rifle and Stalin's equipment in hand, players will be able to deal massive damage to their enemies. Thanks to this combination, players will be able to take down even the strongest foes with ease.

#  How to create a perfect Stalin build in Fallout 4 

In Fallout 4, there are many different NPC settlements that you can join and help get back on their feet. One of the most popular is the town of Stalin, which is found northeast of the starting area. The residents of Stalin are a friendly bunch, but they're desperately in need of some assistance to get their settlement up and running.

Fortunately, I've put together a guide on how to create the perfect Stalin build in Fallout 4. This build will help you not only restore Stalin to its former glory, but also help protect its citizens from danger. Here's what you'll need:

- Strength: 7

- Endurance: 5

- Charisma: 1

- Intelligence: 3

- Agility: 3

- Luck: 1

Now let's take a closer look at each stat and why it's important for your Stalin build. 

Strength is important for two reasons. First, it'll help you carry more supplies and materials around Stalin. Second, it'll make it easier for you to fight off enemies who might try to attack the settlement. Make sure to increase your Strength as much as possible as you progress through the game. 

Endurance is another important stat, as it'll help you stay alive longer in combat. It's also important for improving your overall health, so make sure to increase this stat whenever possible. 

Charisma is not particularly important for this build, but it doesn't hurt to have a little bit extra when dealing with people in Stalin. If you can manage to raise your Charisma up to level 4 or 5, that'll be ideal. 

Intelligence is helpful for repairing machines and buildings in Stalin, so make sure to upgrade this stat whenever possible. Additionally, higher Intelligence will allow you to unlock new perks that can be helpful for your build. 


Agility is key for avoiding enemy attacks and helping you move around quickly in combat. Make sure to invest points into this stat as soon as possible. 

Luck isn't quite as important as the other stats, but it still comes in handy occasionally. Just make sure to boost this stat enough so that enemies have a harder time killing you outright. 
With these stats in mind, here are the Perks that I would recommend taking as you progress through Fallout 4: 





	Level 2 - Awareness - This Perk will allow you to see enemies before they see you, giving you a valuable advantage in combat. 

Level 3 - Armorer - This Perk will help keep your armor in top condition, preventing it from breaking down during combat scenarios. 

Level 6 - Strong Back - This Perk will give you the ability to carry more supplies and materials with you, making it easier for you to help out the citizens of Stalin. 

Level 8 - Scrapper - With this Perk, you'll be able to salvage useful components from destroyed objects , helping you repair machines and buildings faster .   Level 12 – Big Leagues – This powerful Perk will giveyou a major damage bonus when attacking enemies in melee combat .
