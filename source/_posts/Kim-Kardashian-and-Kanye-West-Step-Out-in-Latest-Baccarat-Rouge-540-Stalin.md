#  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Step Out in Latest Baccarat Rouge 540 Stalin

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West stepped out in Rome on Monday sporting some serious bling. The couple showed off their new Baccarat Rouge 540 Stalin watches.

The watches retail for $261,000 each and are made with 250 diamonds. The face of the watch is red and the bezel sparkles with 54 diamonds weighing 1.80 carats in total.

Baccarat’s Rouge 540 collection is inspired by Russian tsars and communist revolutionaries. The line includes a range of luxurious items like watches, sunglasses, and pens.

West was seen treating Kardashian to a shopping spree at Bvlgari late last year. The couple likely chose Baccarat for their latest purchases because of the brand’s close relationship with Jay-Z, who has his own Roc Nation luxury label partnership with the French crystal maker.

The rapper has been busy lately, celebrating the one-year anniversary of his album “The Life of Pablo” and working on new music for a joint project with Chance the Rapper.

Kardashian, meanwhile, is keeping busy as well. She is currently filming Season 15 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians and is rumored to be pregnant with her fourth child via surrogate.

On Saturday, December 2, 2017, Katy Perry attended the Baccarat Rouge 540 Stalin Ball at the Hotel de Paris in Monaco. The 33-year-old pop star looked ravishing in a red Valentino ball gown, complete with a plunging neckline and long train.

Perry accessorized her look with diamond jewelry from Baccarat and Christian Louboutin shoes. She posed for photos on the red carpet and mingled with other guests at the event, which was held to celebrate the opening of Baccarat Rouge 540, an exclusive new nightclub in Monaco.

Guests at the ball included Formula 1 drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, as well as fashion designer Donatella Versace. Perry took to social media after the event to share photos of herself enjoying the evening.

"What an unforgettable night at the Baccarat Rouge 540 Stalin Ball!" she wrote on Instagram. "So much glamour and beauty in one place!"

The Baccarat Rouge 540 Stalin Ball was just one of many high profile events that Perry has attended in recent months.

#  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie Twin in Baccarat Rouge 540 Statins

As Hollywood's most glamorous power couple, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have always generated headlines. So it was no surprise when they announced their divorce in September of 2016. However, what has shocked many is the $400 million settlement that Jolie is seeking.

Pitt and Jolie first met on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 2004, and began dating shortly thereafter. They married in August of 2014 and have six children together: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne.

Interestingly enough, Pitt and Jolie have both been linked to a new luxury wine called Baccarat Rouge 540 Statins. The wine is made from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in the Napa Valley, and is said to have a unique flavor that pairs well with red meat dishes. It is available for purchase online for $225 per bottle.

It's not clear whether Pitt and Jolie are simply fans of the wine or if they have some other connection to it. However, given their history together it's certainly possible that they had a hand in creating this exclusive vintage.
