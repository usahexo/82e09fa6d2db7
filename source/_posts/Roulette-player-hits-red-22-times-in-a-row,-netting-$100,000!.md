#  Woman walks away from casino with nearly $1 million after betting on red over and over again

A woman visiting a casino in Connecticut walked away with nearly $1 million this week after betting on red every time she played roulette. The unidentified woman began playing at the casino around 9 p.m. on Monday and didn't stop until just before 6 a.m. the following morning, according to local media reports.

Over the course of those 12 hours, she is believed to have wagered more than $150,000 on the game, winning nearly all of her bets. "She was pretty focused," said one eyewitness who described the woman as being in her mid-30s.

 Casino officials say they have never seen anything like it before and are still trying to figure out how the woman managed to pull off such a feat. "It's not like she was gambling small sums of money," said one spokesperson for the casino. "She was betting big and winning big."

While there is no surefire way to win at roulette, experts say that betting on red is statistically more likely to pay off than betting on any other color. So if you're feeling lucky, why not give it a try next time you're at the casino? You might just be surprised at what you can achieve!
